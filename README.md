# A-new-CT-score-based-staging-for-melioidosis-pneumonia-to-predict-progression
This repository inlcudes official implementations for CT score of melioidosis pneumonia
## Abstract
**Background:** Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in melioidosis pneumonia.

**Purpose:** To quantitatively extract CT features and evaluate CT score-based staging in predicting melioidosis pneumonia progression.

##Installation
The following command will clone a copy of CT score to your computer using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rsolut1on/A-new-CT-score-based-staging-for-melioidosis-pneumonia-to-predict-progression.git

```
##Results
CT scores of the patients with melioidosis pneumonia based on chest CT scans from the time of onset of the initial symptoms.

The L-BFGS Gaussian process predicted severe outcome patients, and the receiver operating characteristic curve is shown using the CT-score to predict severe in the mild test set and severe set.
